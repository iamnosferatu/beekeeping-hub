⏺ I'll analyze the frontend codebase to identify refactoring opportunities for reducing complexity and increasing reusability. Let me start by examining the component
  structure and looking for patterns of duplication or areas that could benefit from componentization.

⏺ Update Todos

⏺ Task(Search for code duplication patterns)…
  ⎿  Done (22 tool uses · 49.7k tokens · 2m 55.2s)

⏺ Now let me create a comprehensive todo list based on the impact of these refactoring opportunities:

⏺ Update Todos

	 ☐ Create BaseModal component to replace 5+ duplicate modal implementations (DeleteConfirmModal, ArticleDeleteModal, BlockedInfoModal, inline modals)
     ☐ Create useFormValidation hook to eliminate duplicate validation logic across 5+ form pages (Login, Register, Contact, Password forms)
     ☐ Create DataTable component to consolidate 5 admin table implementations (Articles, Tags, Comments, Users, Contact Messages)
     ☐ Migrate remaining direct axios calls to use existing custom hooks in /hooks/api/ (affects 10+ components)
     ☐ Merge LoadingSpinner and LoadingState into single flexible component, replace 15+ inline loading implementations
     ☐ Create FormField component to reduce Form.Group boilerplate across 20+ form fields
     ☐ Create useErrorDisplay hook and standardize on ErrorAlert component (affects 10+ pages)
     ☐ Enhance common EmptyState component to support context-aware features, replace inline empty states
     ☐ Extract BaseCard component for reuse in ArticleCard, forum threads, user cards, tag cards
     ☐ Create StatusBadge component to standardize status display across admin and content pages

⏺ I've created a comprehensive todo list for frontend refactoring based on impact. Here's the summary:

  High Priority (Most Impact)

  1. BaseModal Component - Eliminates 5+ duplicate modal implementations
  2. useFormValidation Hook - Removes validation boilerplate from 5+ forms
  3. DataTable Component - Consolidates 5 admin table implementations
  4. API Call Migration - Standardizes 10+ components using direct axios

  Medium Priority (Significant Impact)

  5. Loading State Consolidation - Replaces 15+ inline loading patterns
  6. FormField Component - Reduces boilerplate in 20+ form fields
  7. Error Handling Standardization - Affects 10+ pages
  8. Enhanced EmptyState - Replaces multiple inline empty states

  Low Priority (Nice to Have)

  9. BaseCard Component - Provides consistency across card types
  10. StatusBadge Component - Standardizes status displays

  The highest impact refactorings focus on eliminating the most code duplication and improving developer experience across the largest number of components.
